# Question

Translate the following code into `async/await` please.

```js
const getAllUsers = () => {
  return fetch('https://example.com/users')
    .then(r => r.json())
    .then(users => {
      console.log('users:', users)
      return users
    })
    .catch(console.warn)
}
```

Make sure to keep all variable and function names the same. The function must behave the same way.


# Answer
const getAllUsers = async () => {
  try{ 
    const r = await fetch('https://example.com/users')
    const users = await r.json()
    }
    try{
      console.log('users:', users)
      return users
    }
    catch (err) {
      console.warn(err)
    }
}

You did great here! Everything was done perfect except for the second try that was added on line 26. Besides from that, great job!
