# Question

When we say "use semantic elements," what does that mean?

Please be sure to give an example of a semantic and non-semantic element in your explanation.

# Answer
Semantic elements are specified HTML elements, such as <header>, which creates a better structure and readability. Non-semantic tags, such as <div>, don't provide as much accessibility when it comes to reading and maintaining your code.
